## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details for Learning

### Files in Your Project:

- **app.py** - Main application file (starts the web server)
- **models.py** - Database structure (users, notes, files, folders)
- **routes.py** - Web page logic (what happens when you click buttons)
- **templates/** - HTML pages (what you see in the browser)
- **static/** - CSS styles and JavaScript
- **uploads/** - Where uploaded files are stored
- **.env** - Configuration settings

### Database:
- Uses **SQLite** (simple file-based database)
- Database file: `notes_app.db`
- Automatically created when you first run the app

### Security Features:
- Passwords are encrypted (hashed)
- File upload restrictions (16MB max, specific file types)
- User sessions for login state
- Protection against common web attacks

## üîß Customization Options

### Change Upload File Types
Edit `routes.py`, find `allowed_file()` function:
```python
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'txt', 'pdf', 'png', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'doc', 'docx'}
```

### Change Max File Size
Edit `.env` file:
```env
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=33554432  # 32MB instead of 16MB
```

### Change Secret Key (Important!)
Edit `.env` file:
```env
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secure-secret-key-here-make-it-long-and-random
```

## üåê Upgrading to PostgreSQL (Advanced)

If you want to use a more powerful database:

1. **Install PostgreSQL**
   - Download from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
   - Remember the password you set for 'postgres' user

2. **Create database**
   ```cmd
   psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE notesdb;"
   ```

3. **Install PostgreSQL support**
   ```cmd
   pip install psycopg2-binary --user
   ```

4. **Edit .env file**
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:5432/notesdb
   ```

## üö® Important Notes

### For Development (What you're doing now):
- ‚úÖ SQLite database is perfect
- ‚úÖ Debug mode is enabled (shows detailed errors)
- ‚úÖ All files stored locally

### For Production (If you want others to access over internet):
- Change `SECRET_KEY` in .env to something very secure
- Set `FLASK_DEBUG=False` in .env
- Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
- Use a proper web server (not `python app.py`)
- Set up proper domain and SSL certificate

## üéâ Congratulations!

You now have a fully functional web application with:
- User authentication
- Note sharing system
- File management with folders
- Public access features
- Anonymous file uploads

This is a complete, working web application that demonstrates many important web development concepts!

## üìö Next Steps for Learning

1. **Explore the code** - Look at `app.py`, `models.py`, and `routes.py`
2. **Modify the templates** - Change how pages look in `templates/` folder
3. **Add new features** - Maybe add note categories or user profiles
4. **Learn about deployment** - How to put your app on the internet
5. **Study web security** - Learn about protecting web applications

## üÜò Need Help?

1. **App won't start?** 
   - Check if Python is installed: `python --version`
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt --user`

2. **Can't access in browser?**
   - Make sure you're going to: http://localhost:5000
   - Check if another app is using port 5000

3. **Database errors?**
   - Delete `notes_app.db` file and restart the app
   - It will create a fresh database

4. **File upload issues?**
   - Check if `uploads/` folder exists
   - Make sure file is under 16MB
   - Check file type is allowed

**Remember**: This app runs on your computer only. To share it with others on the internet, you'd need to learn about web hosting and deployment!
